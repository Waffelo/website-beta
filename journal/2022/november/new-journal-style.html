          I usually write my journal entries in the evening at the end of the day but maybe I can make some change in it. I can
          try to write journal entries trougout the day if I have more time and stamp parts of the entry with time of the writing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today I would like to do some changs on my website again, to improve it and to add some few more features. I maybe will
          reintroduce my old library page and I might create the long promised favorite websites page - pages I find useful and
          informative or cool. I also might do some interesting pages just for fun, or improve some styling of my website.<br>
          The thing I could also add to my home page is the recent journal posts bar, I don't know how it will look yet so I am
          not adding it for now. It might be int that little sidebar or be as a thin bar above the recent blog posts.
        </p>

          I need to start doing programming related tasks again, to learn it. Good programming skills would be great for me
          because I would be able to make my own automatization, useful or fun programs that would benefit me and maybe
          others. I want to focus on electronics programming again, but I am too lazy, I just need to get out of my comfort zones
          to get to it.
