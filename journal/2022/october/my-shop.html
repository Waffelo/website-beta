          Today I have been working on my shop page! I made the first selling item and also some
          shop guidelines and shipping info page. I still need to add a page dedicated to items
          themselves. I will probably do it tomorrow.<br>
          On this page I will mostly sell things made by me, second-hand things I wan't to get rid
          of and make some profit from.

          I also made a smaller front page banner for the shop so people can notice more. I made
          it in GIMP and it doesn't look too bad.

          I will be learning more of the electronics stuff and Ham Radio stuff. I will start
          making some projects that will be on PCBs too! I want to start selling some of the
          things I make. I also want to get a 3D Printer next year to print out some needed
          parts. It will be veeeery useful.<br>
          And by the end of the year I would like to get my own server for my other tech stuff
          like email, chats and maybe pleroma instance and minetest or minecraft server!<br>
          I also have an custom 404 error page not found message! I was thinking about doing
          this for a long time and I finaly done it.
