          Today I have remade the blog cards! They look <b>smaller</b> and better! I also
          made whole div boxes of buttons clickable. I made a projects page for my future
          projects. There will be more stuff coming to the site. I want this website to be
          sort of a hub for me, I don't want to have thousands of profiles everywhere.

          I was supposed to go for a hike to local forest today, but I slept more that I
          was supposed to and missed the opportunity, it will be raining the next days so
          I am out of luck. I will try sometime later, I would love to hide a geocache
          somewhere, but I need to find the right place...

          <br><br>
          My plans for next days are that I will do some programming more, I will learn to
          program in Python and C++, past days I was mostly remaking my website, but now I
          should have most of those things done, I don't have any ideas what to add to the
          website. I am just writing my journal and blog. Even though probably no one reads
          it, it is fun for me and it is a way to express myself. I can also archive some of
          my thoughts like that and come back to it down the road few years later..<br>
          Anyways... I would also like to change my system colorscheme a little bit, make the
          pink and purple colors more important. I would also like to try Artix and Gentoo
          Linux distributions again. I will try to do full disk encryptions in a virtual-machine
          since I hate to use a system that doesn't have encrypted root partition.<br>
          Back to the projects, I would like to focus on some electronic devices like IoT
          and some fun electronics. I might also make something useful when I will have 
          some problem that I would try to solve with my hobby. I would love to make a
          protogen visor for fun, maybe one that would be more advanced.

          <br><br>
          Today I feel more lonely than in past weeks, it keeps getting worse and worse, I
          keep spiraling down into more loneliness and sadness, I have to do more stuff to
          drown these feelings.. After socializing more at some places, I started hating 
          people more, a lot of people are just morons. But there are also a lot of good
          people that I have met, you can know when I like someone, I keep talking to them.
          I would love to meet some more cool people that aren't nazis or some weird people
          full of hate and retardation.
