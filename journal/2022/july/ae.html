            In recent days I accidentaly broke DNS records and my website doesn't work
            on my home network because of SSL mismatch, but it works for everyone else.
            I had to set up an DNS connection on my laptop to be able to view my website.
            At least my family won't see my website.

            Today I have been learning some arduino programming, I learned how to use
            the arduino-cli command line program, I have programmed a temperature and
            humidity indicator with LCD screen. It works fine, it is a small small simple
            program.. Later I will try to do more complex programs and circuits. <br>
            I want to make a circuit with arduino and speaker that will scream 
            "Close the door!!" when the doors in my room will be opened for too long, I
            just hate when someone opens my doors and leaves them open. &gt;:C 
          </p>

            I am going to create a guide page, I will publish guides or so called tutorials
            there about various things like how to install Arch Linux or how to set up an
            pwnagotchi. I will create various categories later when it gets populated with
            guides.<br>
            I will also start writing more blog posts, my next blog post should be about 
            my pwnagotchi. It will be just an article on what it is and what it is used for.
            I will also link an guide on how to assemble and set it up.<br>
            I want to make a new website element, an higlighted box of text that will be used.. 
            perhaps in guides, so people notice some important warnings like "if you do this,
            there is a high chance that your battery will explode!".<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            Today I also redone my neovim configs, so now it all works better and looks nicer!
            I have added coc autocomplete plugin and also set my colorscheme to catppuccin, as
            I am currently on KDE Plasma themed with Catppuccin colors. I will maybe get back to
            tiling window manager soon again.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also added codeblocks! This will help me in making guides on how to set up stuff! Here
            is an example:
