            Early in the morning today, I have started working on a <b>library</b> page, and it was worth it.
            I will try to <b>track</b> my books with it. I also need to create pages for invididual books and
            write something about them, but maybe some other day because I am lazy for that rn.<br>
            Tomorrow I would like to go for a <b>hike</b> alone and <b>hide a geocache</b>, I have one already prepared, but
            I don't know where to hide it yet.. I will also try to <b>find some geocaches</b>. I enjoy geocaching, it 
            can be really <b>rewarding</b> to find something cool during a long hike. I would like to hide more
            geocaches in my free time and maintain them, because it feels like the hobby is dying out.<br><br>

            I haven't really done any C++ programming or electronics lately, I need to look into it more often
            because I want to learn how to program <b>microcontrollers</b> and maybe do some <b>IoT devices</b>.
            I want to build some really cool stuff, but I need to learn and practice more. I will try my best to
            dedicate more time to that. <br><br>

            :(
