          <p>
            Today I have created a new blog post about Ham Radio, I spent like two hours at it. I feel like I could
            spend more time on it and make it a lot better, I will try to put more effort to my blog articles next
            time. <br>
            I am also getting more interested in radio communication, today I have found two new radio frequencies.
            One is for local railway company radios and second for city's police radios. I have listened a bit to
            them today but haven't heard too much because I was at bad spots where was too much interfierence. A lot
            of trees were in my way and a lot of high buildings.<br><br>
            Two days ago I have made gallery page and added some pics to it. It might not look the best but it works
            so I am keeping it. I will create more categories for gallery, such as art and 3D renders if I will do them.
